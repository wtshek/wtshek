3. The entrepreneur stories (WIP)
An app that allows entrepreneur to post their stories and it will categorise their stories by location, industry and gender. I want to build this app because I am interested in small businesses which are closer to ordinary people. Also, I hope the reader can get some location-specific insight from their stories. <br>
