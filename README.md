2. My Blog
A space where I publish my learning and experience. It is important to me because I think writing is a very important step in understanding. I use Notion as the CMS

3. The entrepreneur stories (WIP)
An app that allows entrepreneur to post their stories and it will categorise their stories by location, industry and gender. I want to build this app because I am interested in small businesses which are closer to ordinary people. Also, I hope the reader can get some location specific insight from their stories.
